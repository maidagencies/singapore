## Chapter 1 - Why engage a maid agency?
### 9 benefits of hiring a maid agency
In today’s age where women are increasingly joining professional work, it is difficult to handle both professional and house work life. You will always need to create time to clean your house and do other chores. It is, therefore, advisable that you hire a helper from a maid agency to help do your household chores. Here are the reasons why you should hire a helper through a maid agency:
#### Professional training
All maids from a maid agency are trained professionals who can handle cleaning chores. Some of these chores might be impossible for you to handle. All the cleaning tasks are performed to the details you might not have the time for. You don’t, therefore, have to train the maid yourself.
#### Possible replacement
At some point, your present maid might become sick or go for a holiday. She might even be on official leave. You don’t have to go looking for a replacement maid on your own. A maid agency will provide a replacement for your housemaid. This will ensure there is no interruption in your work.
#### No wastage on cleaning products
A maid agency will provide your helper training on all materials and equipment. All these coming at the highest quality. Since the domestic workers are trained at the agency, they can use the equipment without much of a problem. Talk about matching manpower with equipment!
#### Strict screening
The maid agency will do a total background check on the maids. This is important especially as concerns security of your premises and its contents. If anything gets lost in your home, it will be much easier to trace the whereabouts of your maid. Also, your maid will not even try to compromise your security if they know their background is known.
#### Customised schedule
When you work with a maid agency, you will get a customised cleaning schedule. The maid agency will assess your specific needs to find out the exact cleaning you require. The result is an emphasis on areas that are of greater importance while not neglecting the rest.
#### Giving you extra time
When you get a helper from maid agency, you will be able to devote more time to family and friends. This is because you will have lots of extra time on your hands. You might even get time to pursue a hobby you always wanted. After all, you are no longer doing house chores.
#### Increased house value
Cleaning the house yourself might mean neglecting many things like water and leave it to turn into moulds. Stains that were small may turn into big spots that you may not be able to solve due to time constraints. However, when you hire a helper from a maid agency, your house will be cleaned to the core. This can improve the future resale value of your house.
#### Guaranteed cleaning
Hiring a maid from a maid agency will guarantee you daily cleaning services. This will come as part of the agreement you sign with the maid agency. 
#### Outsourcing of work
Hiring a maid takes up a lot of time. And in sunny Singapore where time is never enough, outsource the menial tasks to the maid agencies so that you have more time to spend on the finer things in life.

## Chapter 2 - How to choose the right maid agency?
Gone are the days when people outsourced their maids through neighbours, officemates, friends, and relatives. Going this route can be a time waster, especially if you need a maid immediately. That’s where the maid agency should come in handy. Yet you might have no idea which maid agency to choose from among the hundreds available. Here are a few things to look out for:
#### Permits and licenses
The maid agency you want to use to get a house help should be registered by the relevant authorities. A maid must have a license that allows it to act as an agency for labour recruitment. This is in addition to that of its establishment as a business. With these, you can know the maid agency is legally operational. They also show the agency has the capacity to hire, train, and deploy maids. A licensed agency is also able to inform its clients of their rights as responsibilities as employers. They do this for the helper too.
#### Professional affiliations
The legitimacy of a maid agency is made solid by its affiliations. Check that the agency is a member of state associations and if they have a dedicated lawyer who advises them. If the agency works with a certifying body, then it can ensure the maids are well trained and certified. There should, however, be no connivance with the certifying body.
#### Online presence
We live in the digital world where it is necessary to check the website of any company you are dealing with. The same goes for a maid agency. How the agency site looks should tell you much about the kind of services they provide. A little browsing through its homepage is enough for weighing the credibility of the agency itself. If the website looks professional, then the agency is prudent and serious about its business.On the homepage, you will find vital details such as its physical address, business hours, and contact numbers. You will also learn about things such as its hiring processes, the fee if charges and the terms of payment. The website should feature reviews and testimonials from previous clients. This will help you judge if the agency is reliable in its maid-hiring services or not.
The maid agency’s activities on social media can tell you a lot about its trustworthiness. Most agencies know the power of Facebook, twitter, and Instagram in the generation of leads. The reason they are present on these platforms is to keep prospective clients fully updated and engaged.
#### Variety
Most people in need of maids have very diverse housekeeping requirements. It’s, therefore important that you get an agency that provides a variety of maids you can choose from. Your choices don’t have to be confined to babysitters and cooks alone. A good maid agency should be able to provide helpers who can tutor your children and do pet sitting. Although this will come at a higher cost, you will enjoy the variety of services they are able to provide.
So, now you know what to look for in a maid agency!

## Chapter 3 - Advantages of hiring a foreign maid in Singapore
It’s hard to search the whole of Singapore without finding a family that isn’t in need of a maid. This is because services of domestic workers are highly affordable in the city-state. Many families also enjoy numerous benefits from engaging a full-time maid from an agency. As working parents, you are able to focus on your job. It also gives you so much flexibility in your schedule.
Here are the advantages of hiring a foreign maid:
#### Handle most household chores
When you have a domestic worker, you and your family don’t have to engage in domestic chores. The maid from the agency is able to take care of the children, pets, and the elderly. They also handle duties such as doing laundry, cleaning the house, cooking, and buying groceries. The family, therefore, doesn’t have to spend time handling household chores. You can spend more quality time with your children and focus on your work. Without the help of a maid agency, it will be difficult for both parents to work full-time.
#### Quality time
With a maid from the agency, you will have lots of free time. You can be able to do the things you enjoy like taking your children out for a fun day. You can do all these with the assurance that your house is in good hands. After a long day’s work, you and your spouse can enjoy a nice meal. Imagine doing this in a house that’s sparkling clean. Why worry when you don’t have to cook or clean?
With increased flexibility, you and your spouse can go out for a spontaneous dinner date, whenever you feel like. You also able to easily handle emergencies at work or a home. If for instance, your child fell ill, it will be much easier to have him treated. All these without having to look for an emergency babysitter to take care of your children.
#### Mentoring your children
If your maid is from an agency, she is most likely to be reasonably educated. Since she spends lots of time with your children, she can act as a mentor and friend they need. When the children need assistance with their homework, your maid from the agency will be there to help you.If you have a maid from countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, the better. Your children will grow up appreciating other cultures outside Singapore, which gives them a greater worldview.
#### Take good care of your maid.
Any employer is responsible for the health and well-being of the foreign maid you hired from an agency. You need to make a provision for proper accommodation, proper medical care, and safe working conditions. Your maid from the agency should get enough mental and physical rest. As a rule, you should give her a regular rest day, at least once a week. All you have to do is agree on which day of the week she will take time off duty. Your maid agency will ensure that the agreement is in writing.
There is, therefore, no reason why you shouldn’t hire a foreign maid through an agency.
